**Face Detection and Recognition Model**

**Overview**

This project implements a face detection and recognition system using Python. The goal of this project is to accurately detect faces in images and match them to labeled faces in a dataset. The project is designed to assess the ability to develop, integrate, and optimize machine learning models for facial recognition tasks.

**Features**

Face Detection: Utilizes the Dlib library's pre-trained model to detect faces in images with various lighting and angle conditions.
Face Recognition: Extracts facial features using Dlib's deep learning-based face recognition model and matches detected faces to known labeled faces.
Performance Metrics: Measures the accuracy of the face recognition model using standard metrics and optimizes the model for faster inference times.
Scalability: The model is designed to handle large datasets and is optimized for speed without sacrificing accuracy.

**Project Structure**

data/: Contains the dataset of labeled faces.
models/: Includes pre-trained models and the face recognition model.
src/: Source code for face detection, feature extraction, and face matching.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model evaluation.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the project.
README.md: Project description, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

**Usage**

Face Detection:
The script detect_faces.py detects faces in an image and saves the output with bounding boxes.

Face Recognition:
The script recognize_faces.py matches detected faces to the labeled dataset and returns the recognized identities.

**Evaluation**

The performance of the face recognition model is measured using accuracy, and the model is optimized for faster inference times. Detailed evaluation results can be found in the notebooks/ directory.

**Optimization Techniques**

The project includes several optimization techniques to enhance model performance:

Model Pruning: Removing unnecessary weights to speed up inference.

Quantization: Reducing the precision of the model to improve computational efficiency.
